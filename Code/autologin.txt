This file is to allow for ssh login without a password on a server

This is for Host A / user a to Host B / user b
example: flip to os1
Steps:
On Host A, type in the following commands
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
	- press enter to save in the default directory (~/.ssh)
	- press enter to have no passphrase (twice)
ssh b@B mkdir -p .ssh
	- use username@os1.engr.oregonstate.edu
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
ssh b@B
	- going over to Host B
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
	- Will not work if this is not changed

Now exiting and sshing back will not prompt you for a password!

Protip: add a shortcut in .bashrc
alias os1="ssh username@os1.engr.oregonstate.edu"
